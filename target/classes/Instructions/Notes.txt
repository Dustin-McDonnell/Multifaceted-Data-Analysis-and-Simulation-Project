CSV stick it in your Resume
One of the most common ways to export or convey data is the CSV file typing
It contains a header of all the expected value types and every values is seperated by a comma.
Hench Comma separated Value.
Notepad files can be saved as csv that the computer will understand how to interoperate.
Excel also knows how to make this work.

Project 2
Program Plotter
Pick a formula/function that you like Ex. Y=mx+b

Write a program that plots the output in csv
Pick a function
Pick a starting and ending points for your x values, ex, -10.0 to 10.0 in increments of .1
PLug in those values into your function so that you get a y value
Store the x and y values into a data structure of your choice
Use any file exporting technique from your past or the internet(cite it if you're not free handling it with no references)
to export out as your data.csv

Plotter Results
Open in excel and create a graph
Make sure that the program accepts parameters to determine the range
ie 0-100. -100 to 100
Also write a parameter to determine the number of points to plot, or the interval between points
Collect sample outputs of this program in excel chart form showing several different configurations

Salting
What is salting? Its when you add garbage to your data or otherwise mess it up.
Why would we want to salt?
Compared Apple search to Google search.

Program a Salter
Write a program, it accepts a csv(of x y values)
Loop through the y values and +/- a random number from it.
The random number comes from a range you can configure
Be sure when you're representing the output,
that you chose a significantly large salt value.
Have significant number of data points. (No, 10 is not enough.)

Salting Results
Part1.Parent.runseveral tsts with different salt values
Testing on plots with high and low number of data points

Open in excel and create a graph.
The goal is to see the volatility. Show all of your work.

Let's try to reverse the damages
This one is going to be an attempt to smooth the salted data.
Smoothing or cleaning up damaged data, is common enough.

Program Graph smoother
Write a program that loads salted data. (Technically any data, but its purpose will be to smooth salted data.
Have you program loop through and replace the y values with the average of the y values around it.
You will need to pick a range, we'll call it the windowValue
Ex. If range is 3, take 3 points left and right of your index add then up and divide.
Replace the index value with the new Y value.
Iterate to next X point.
If there are not enough points on left or right, use as many as you can,
Ie. At far l;eft of graph, you'd only take the right 3 points and index an divide by four.
Open in excel and create a graph
Try smoothing your data more than once, what does the data look like the 2nd, 3rd, etc

Results
Write a report about the results. Use figures, screen shots, and whatever you need to covey your idea.

Make sure to include
A write up about what your program does and the results.
Comparison of graph that you made.
Change bounds graph and observe differences when your configurable variables are modified.
Be brave, use big numbers and small numbers, and explore.
Consider ways to modify the 3 programs to make them better.
